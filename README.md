# openGLCamera
Class Assignment dealing with Cubes and Camera Movement using C++ in Visual Studio.
It does require you to add both GLM and GLFW to the project files to run. 
GLM helps deal with vector mathematics and GLFW allows for keyboard and mouse inputs.

This assignment was about creating objects or cubes in this case from scratch and manipulating them into a pyramid. It also had the secondary task of applying
keyboard and mouse inputs to succesfully move around the environment
